Protect

This is a simple defend from bombardment game,
where I tried to use a combination of techniques learned from the pong and mario tutorials.

I decided to not implement animation for aesthetic reasons.  I wanted to have an old time arcade feel.

In the game you control a square with the arrow keys.  
You can move left and right, and jump with up key.
The goal is to survive as long as possible while defending your land from falling dots.
The more dots collected, the higher your score.
If you are jumping while collecting a dot, you get extra points, and you jump again.
The more dots you collect during a jumping combo, the more extra points you get each dot.

The game ends if you fall, or you are down to one piece of land.
